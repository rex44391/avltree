# avltree
This is a practice for avl tree in data structure!
I don't guarantee its bug free.

You can use it with gcc compiler: gcc -o 1 tree.c!
If you have any question about how to use it, please see the main function in tree.c file.
The data in leaf's structure is pointed by a void pointer, so you can put any kind of data in the leaf throught the correspondent pointer.
